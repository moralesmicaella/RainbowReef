I made this project using Java version 8 update 171 in NetBeans version 8.2.
To run the game, go to the jar folder and click the jar file. The jar file must be in the same folder as the Resources folder.
To run the game using Netbeans, click new project, which is under the file tab on the upper corner of the Netbeans window. 
The category should be in Java, and in the right corner, under the section called projects, click Java project with existing sources. Click Next. 
Enter a project name then click next. Click add folder, then choose the folder that contains the Resources folder and the RainbowReef folder, which should be the name of this repo. 
Click Next. Lastly, just click finish. RainbowReefGame.java holds the main method in this project. Open that file then go to the run tab in the main menu bar and look for Set Project Configuration in the dropdown.
Click customize. This should bring you to the Project properties and make sure that Run is chosen under the categories. Set the current working directory to this repo folder. 
Then just hit the play button to run this game.

Note:
Use the mouse the navigate around the main menu
Use the left and right arrow keys to move Katch (shell)
